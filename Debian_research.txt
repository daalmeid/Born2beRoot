-------------------------------------TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS PROJECT-------------------------------------

APT - Advanced Package Tool, is a free-software user interface that works with core libraries to install
	and remove software on Debian and Debian-based Linux Distribuitions. It simplifies the software manage-
	ment on unix-like computer systems by automating the retrieval, configuration and installation of
	software packages, either from precompiled files or by compiling source code.

sudo and su - su (substitute user, super user or switch user) allows to login as the root account and do 
whatever with the system; sudo (substitute user do or super user do) allows to elevate the status of the
current user to have root privileges temporarily. Once a certain amount of time has passed, hte user has to
reenter the password to regain root privileges. su is used to switch from one account to another. Without sudo,
an unauthorized user cannot install, remove or change any piece of software, thus avoiding possible exploitation.

After installing sudo, use "su -l" to restart the environnement with all the acesses of root, instead of inheriting
the env from the non-sudo user. Then, "adduser daalmeid sudo" to add user to the group. Create group user42 with
"addgroup user42" and then adduser to new group.

"apt-get install <program>" to install new software, sudo before it if not on root.

After downloading openssh-server, edit ssh_config with sudo vim to change the port to 4242 (from 22);

run "sudo service ssh status" to verify if the port was changed;

UFW - Firewall, you can check its status with "sudo ufw status, enable it with "sudo ufw enable" and allow a
specific port (like the one attributed to ssh server) with "sudo ufw allow 4242";

https://manpages.debian.org/jessie/sudo/sudoers.5.en.html - sudo.config;

Strong password policy - login.defs to setup expration date for the password, minimum number of days before
a modification and warning message (7 days);

enforce_for_root - Note that root is not asked for an old password so the checks that compare the old and new 
password are not performed;

port forwarding rule on VM - settings -> Network -> Advanced -> Port forwarding:

|Name		| Protocol | Host IP (sudo service ssh status) | Host port | Guest IP | Guest port|
|Random		|	TCP	   |			127.0.0.1			   | 	4242   | 10.0.2.15|    4242	  |

Get host IP : ip a, in front of the first "inet"; Get guest IP : ip a, in front of the second "inet";

top -bn2 --> The -n option is the number of iterations the top command should use before ending. We avoid 
using the first loop because the metrics we retrieve will be values since boot. Hence, weâ€™ve taken the 
second iteration.
